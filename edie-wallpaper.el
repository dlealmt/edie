;; Edie Wallpaper changes the current wallpaper at random, after a certain
;; user-defined interval, using images found in a user-defined
;; directory.  It also provides a command to delete wallpaper images
;; you no longer want.

;; By default, Edie-Wallpaper requires `nitrogen' to be installed, but you can
;; use other background setters as long as you customize `edie-wallpaper-program'
;; and `edie-wallpaper-program-args' correctly.

;; To start using Edie Wallpaper, be sure to at least set the right path to
;; your wallpaper images directory.  Then run `edie-wallpaper-mode'.
